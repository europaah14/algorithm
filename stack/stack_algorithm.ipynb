    "Generally, we would use the stack algorithm by using stack's property, i.e., **the push and pop all happen at the top of the stack (last element)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the use of stack is like a 'waitlist', which stores the task that needs to be executed if certain condition is met. <ins>Note the priority of the task is higher for the tasks stored later (i.e., top of stack)<ins>\n",

    "One straightforward algorithm example would be: stack can be used to simulate a recursion style algoritm.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., \n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to compute fibinacci sequence at 5, `f(5)`. This can be reduced to `f(3) + f(4)`, the implementation is as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a stack and a variable to store final result\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Put the decomposition of `f(5)` in a stack. (In this iteration, stack becomes `[f(3), f(4)]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pop the stack, i.e., `f(4)`, which reduces to `f(2) + f(3)`. (Note when the popped `f()` reaches its base case, we can update result variable instead of decomposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat step 2 - 3, When stack is empty, we will have the final result. \n",
    "\n",
    "    `[f(3), f(2), f(3)]` $\\rightarrow$ `[f(3), f(2), f(1), f(2)]` $\\rightarrow$ ... $\\rightarrow$ `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the operation stored in stack later needs to be executed first, which aligns with the property of stack algorithm highlighted in the second paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side Note:** this is what actually happens behind the implementation of recursion, and the stack is called call stack, which stores the function before execution. This is the reason why the space complexity of recursion is not O(1).\n",

    "<ins>Algorithm2 (Monotonic Stacking)</ins>:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another frequently used algorithm is *Monotonic Stacking*. The algorithm's main idea is to repeat the process: maintain the stack such that it is **monotonic**; when the monotonicity is broken, we update the stack and result variable until the stack is monotonic again. Similar to algorithm 1, the elements stored in stack are the tasks waiting to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful when the final result needs to use the monotonic nature, e.g., for each element, we want to find the first smaller element. To do so, we can maintain a non-decreasing stack, when the monotonic relationship is broken, it implies that the new element is the answer to some of the elements in the stack, i.e., the new element `< stack[i]`, for `i = k, ... len(stack) - 1`. The implementation of **non-decreasing stack algorithm** is as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have input array `arr`, then\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize `stack` and the result variable `res`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through each element in `arr`: for each `arr[i]`, do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - While `arr[i] < stack[-1]`: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        -  pop `stack[-1]` \n",
    "        \n",
    "        -  update `res`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If `arr[i] >= stack[-1]`, push `arr[i]` to `stack`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return `res`\n",
    "\n",
    "This **non-decreasing stack algorithm** is useful when the solution is based on `arr[i]` and the first upcoming element in `arr` that is `< arr[i]`. E.g., if `arr` represents stock price in each day, and request to find the days elapsed until first negative profit day shows up for each date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In total, there are *increasing*, *decreasing*, *non-increasing*, *non-decreasing* stack depending on the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the `for` loop terminates, there might be some **elements left in stack**, they are the elements that do not have answers for (e.g., these elements do not have upcoming negative profit days). Deal with them based on the problems' requiement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the problem requires index for the calculation (e.g., days elapsed), pop in the algorithm will shift the original index to the left. Thus, we also need to store the original index in stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every element that doesn't meet monotonicity is popped, becasue we want to maintain the monotonicity for the stack and we already have answers for these popped elements, e.g., we would know their negative profit days; however, if we still need them in the future calculation, then we cannot pop them, which is a limitation of this algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The advantages of this algorithm is to save repeating look-up (e.g., avoid checking all the stock prices in the upcoming days for each stock price)\n",
    "\n",
