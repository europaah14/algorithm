    "**General Idea**: Partition `nums1` and `nums2` and hence can find the median based on the partitioned cutoff index. I.e., all elements that is before (inclusively) the cutoff index in `nums1` and `nums2` are the first half of the 'merged' array\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting with **shorter array**, `a`, use its midpoint `mid1` as the initial cutoff point, since we know the partition size, so the cutoff index for the longer array, `b`, is `mid2 = n_half - mid1 - 2`. \n",

    "    Suppose `mid1` is the correct partition cutoff index, then\n",
    "\n",
    "    `a[0], ..., a[mid1], b[0], ..., b[n_half - mid1 - 2]` constructs the left partition\n",

    "2. To determine if the current cutoff index `mid1` is correct, the following needs to be satisfied\n",

    "    `min(a[mid1 + 1], a[mid2 + 1]) >= max(a[mid1], b[mid2])`\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Then we can run binary search on `a` by setting `start, end = 0, len(a) - 1`, and use the result of step2 in each loop to find the correct cutoff index\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Case1: `a[mid1 + 1] < b[mid2]`: this implies the `b[mid2]` is too large, we should include more elements in `a` and less elements in `b` in left partition\n",

    "1. why starting with shorter array\n",
    "\n",
    "    If starting with the longer array, the value of `mid2` can be incorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "    e.g., `a = [2, 3, 4], b = []` $\\Rightarrow$ `mid1 = 1, mid2 = 1 - 1 - 2 = -2`, which will require additional work to fix the issue\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, if `a` is the shorter array, such issue will not happen (can prove by contradiction)\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. why `mid2 = n_half - mid1 - 2 `\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, in order to have `n_half` elements in left partition, we need `n_half - (mid1 + 1)` elements in `b`, which will be `n_half - (mid1 + 1) - 1` as for index\n",

    "    It's possible that none / all of the elements in `a` belongs to left partition, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    i.e., `mid1 = -1` or `mid1 + 1 = len(a)` (same for mid2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will give out of bound error when access value in `a`, so we need to assign them with special value to overcome this issue\n",
    "\n",
    "    i.e., `a[-1] = -inf` and `a[len(a)]` which still makes the logic work.\n",

    "4. How to set the while loop guard\n",
    "\n",
    "    Normally, while loop guard is set to be `start <= end`. However, when `start > end`, `mid1` has not been placed to correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "    e,g, suppose the last loop set `start, end = 0, -1`, which implies none of the elements in `a` belongs to left partition. However, when loop is terminated, `mid1` hasn't been set to -1 in while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To overcome this issue, we need to run one extra loop, by setting `while start <= end + 1` or `while True` or manually adjust `mid1` and `mid2`\n"
